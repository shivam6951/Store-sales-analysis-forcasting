INTRODUCTION: This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a superstore to extract meaningful insights and forecast future sales. The analysis involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a forecasting model using linear regression.
DATASET: The dataset used in this project is superstore_sales.csv, which contains sales data from a superstore.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves understanding the dataset structure, handling missing values, and visualizing key features to uncover patterns and insights.

Key Steps:
Data Overview: Displaying the basic structure and summary statistics of the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
Visualizations: Plotting various features to understand distributions and relationships.

Sales Forecasting
The forecasting model is built using linear regression to predict future sales based on historical data.

Key Steps:
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for modeling.
Train-Test Split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training a linear regression model on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the test set using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Results
The project successfully identifies key patterns in the sales data and builds a model to forecast future sales with reasonable accuracy.
